This data could be helpful in identifying certain patterns or high-risk areas for car-drivers. Some ideas for use include:

* Analyzing what time of day or day of the week is most likely to incur violations
* Finding which streets or blocks are most ticketed
* Combining this data with the aldermanic district or neighborhood KML files to show which areas of the city are best and worst for parking violations
* Determining what parking offenses are most often ticketed
